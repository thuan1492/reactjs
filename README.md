This is basic web app to manage the products. 
  
### Library Support
  1. Jquery: Library help to query data from back end.
  2. react-bootstrap: use to design the UI such as Modal, Input Form and Button .
  3. dataTables: This help to create and query data quickly because it contains the filter and search function.
     
### Technology and Architecture
	React Hooks is used to manage the data routing. I used this because it loads data immediately when i update or add new data. 
However, this technology also take much data of network because it always load data.
	About the structure of code, the code is seperated to 4 parts. First part is the main of react app and it contains all other parts. 
The second part is the outline of table and it covers 2 other parts. The third part's role is that loading data of each row in the table.
And the last one is the input form for updating product function.
	


### To do before access the web app
	You should turn off the security of your browser because I deloyed free on Heroku cloud so that is the limited. The security of browser must be turned off before access the link.
### For Add New Product or Update Product
	After submit the form (all valid input) for Update or add new product, the web site will take 5 or 7 seconds to finish because the Heroku cloud a bit slow.
